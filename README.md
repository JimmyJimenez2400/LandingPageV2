# LandingPageV2

This Project was creating a landing page by using flexbox! Using the properties that make a page responsive.

## Challenges

Some of the challenges I've faced in this project were:
+ Understanding how Flexbox actually works
+ Using the shorthand flex property on children items
+ Making the page responsive
